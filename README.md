# Homework 2: Portfolio Website

## My portfolio website for my first weeks of learning.

**This website was built with all the knowledge aquired during my first week in the *UCI Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp***

In this app I used HTML, CSS, and Styling libraries to create a website that followed the directions of the assignment.

>This Website has an about me page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. Although not fully functional it shows what I have learned and what i've been able to achieve in just 1 week of applied learning.
